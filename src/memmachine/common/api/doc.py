    hyphens, colon, and Unicode characters.

    Each project acts as an isolated memory namespace. All memories (episodes)
    inserted into a project belong exclusively to that project. Queries,
    listings, and any background operations such as memory summarization or
    knowledge extraction only access data within the same project. No
    cross-project memory access is allowed.

    Retrieve the episode count for a project.

    An *episode* is the minimal unit of memory stored in the MemMachine system.
    In most cases, a single episode corresponds to one message or interaction
    from a user. Episodes are appended as the project accumulates conversational
    or operational data.

    - If `types` only contains `"semantic"`, memories are added only to Semantic memory
    - If `types` contains both, memories are added to both types

    Each memory message represents a discrete piece of information to be stored
    in the project's memory system. Messages can include content, metadata,
    timestamps, and other contextual details.

    The producer field indicates who created the message, while the
    produced_for field specifies the intended recipient. These fields help
    provide context for the memory and if provided should be user-friendly names.
